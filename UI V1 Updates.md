UI V1 Updates

- The "okay" days are orange, they should be yellow
- Each calendar box is too big. Let's set a max width and height of 50px. 
- The entire app should be centered within the viewport. 
- Set a max width for the app content to be 430px
- Let's choose a new font other than the default font. What are your suggestions?
- Squares that don't correspond to a day in the month should have a transparent background
